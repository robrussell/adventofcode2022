    "In part 2 we remove the `worry_level //= 3` and increase the number of rounds from 20 to 10000. This makes the worry level numbers unusably large. So how do we \"find another way to keep your worry levels manageable\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the input, the test is always divisibility by a prime. The first thing that's apparent is that worry levels of 190,000 and 19 are both divisible by 19. But some operations are multiplication and some are addition. An addition is actually the harder of the two here. If the operation is `old * 13` then it has the same effect on a worry level of 190,000 or 19: the result of both still divisible by 19 and also will be divisible by 13. However if the operation is `old + 1` then item with a worry level of 19 becomes 20 and the 190,000 becomes 190,001. The factors of 190,000 are 7 and 27,143. So a strategy of reducing worry level using division would fail here.\n",

    "1. multiply by one of a small number of factors\n",

    "Storing a list like [2, 5, 10, 19] instead of the number 1900 is an option. How does it look?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It makes multiplication easy: just add another factor to the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. It makes addition much harder. Adding $1900 + 1$ makes a prime. Now the entire list of factors needs to be multiplied to create an impossibly large number and re-factored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It might make testing for a prime factor somewhat easier - looking for the factor in the list will find the prime. The number 10 isn't prime but as long as each prime factor is present at least once then it can be found by searching the list.\n",

Specifically divisibility by the fixed set of factors in $F$. Understanding divisiblity doesn't require the exact values of each $M_i$. That is to say, $F_i \\times M_i$ has the same effect on divisbility whether $M_i$ is 1 or 1,000,001. So define an operation $D$ that reduces each $M_i$ to 1 if it has a value greater than 0.
