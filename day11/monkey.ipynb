    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Monkey 0:\n",
    "  Starting items: 79, 98\n",
    "  Operation: new = old * 19\n",
    "  Test: divisible by 23\n",

    "    If false: throw to monkey 3\n",

    "Monkey 1:\n",
    "  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74\n",

    "Starting with the definition of a Monkey: There are a few things that are consistent which could be treated as language requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* indentation\n",
    "* order of the lines\n",
    "* text before the colon\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll make a `Monkey` class and initialize the attributes from the input with these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* leading whitespace and blank lines don't matter\n",
    "* embedded whitespace (with runs of whitespace treated as a single space) is used as a delimeter\n",
    "* the definition of Monkey `N` starts with a line that begins with the letter \"M\" at the beginning of the line. The id of the monkey comes after the first \" \" and ends with the \":\"\n",
    "* the ids in the input are numbers but no math happens so just treat it as a string\n",
    "* the `if` attribute uses a similar parsing rule: between the space and \":\" is the value\n",
    "* the values in the example are `true` and `false`, turn them into booleans\n",
    "* For each line after the monkey id line until the next monkey id line\n",
    "  * the \":\" delimites the division between an attribute tag and the attribute definition\n",
    "  * leading whitespace and blank lines don't matter\n",
    "  * the first character (non-whitespace) selects the attribute type\n",
    "  * each attribute has a corresponding class definition\n",
    "  * attributes are: `starting items` (\"S\"), `operation` (\"O\"), `test` (\"T\"), `if` (\"I\")\n",
    "  * the `if` attributes follow `test` in all the examples but there's only one `test` so the order can be ignored\n",
